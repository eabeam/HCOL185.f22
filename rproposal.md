# Research Proposal Assignment 

*[Back to index](index.html)*

[TOC]



**You can access October 11 [presentation slides here](07-01 Research Proposal.pdf) or on BB.** 

## Objective

The goal of this submission is for you to select one research idea, flesh out as many details as possible about how to pursue it, and link it to the existing literature.  You can think of your research proposal as the skeleton of “baby paper": a summary of what your question is, why it matters, and how you intend to solve it, with lots and lots of information on that "how."



## Components

There are three components. You can submit them as three separate documents, or you can combine them into one. 

1. Annotated bibliography (20 pts)
2. *Detailed* outline of methodology (27 pts)
3. Refined research idea (8 pts)



## Annotated bibliography 

The objective of the annotated bibliography is twofold: (1) to situate your work in the broader economics literature; and (2) to get as many specific tips/approaches as possible to help you implement your experiment. I hope that it also will make writing your research paper much easier!

### What is an annotated bibliography?

> A bibliography is a list of sources (books, journals, Web sites,  periodicals, etc.) one has used for researching a topic. Bibliographies  are sometimes called “References” or “Works Cited” depending on the  style format you are using. A bibliography usually just includes the  bibliographic information (i.e., the author, title, publisher, etc.).
>
> An annotation is a summary and/or evaluation. Therefore, an annotated  bibliography includes a summary and/or evaluation of each of the  sources.

### What do I need to do?

Start with the idea that you selected as most promising. You may refine it based on feedback, further reflection, etc.

**Important:** Each group member will individually annotate at least 2 articles, of which 1 must be a peer-reviewed academic article. As a group, make sure that at least **two** of the total set of articles are from the list of economics journals below. 

For each included article, include the following:

1. Student author of the annotation
2. Full bibliographic information. As a group, pick one: [MLA, APA, or Chicago style,](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/resources.html) and adhere to it.
3. The annotations, preferably one bullet point for each of the four elements:
   1. Nature of source: peer-reviewed academic journal (what discipline), working  paper, white paper (ie reports from major organizations), other.
   2. Key findings or arguments of the source: It’s in your interest to be quite detailed here (*I like to use these to draw on when I write my paper*)
   3. Assessment: How does it compare to other sources? (findings support or contrast)?  Is the source biased or objective? What is the goal of the source?
   4. Reflection: Is this useful to your question? How does it help you shape your  argument? How can you use this source in your project? (*Here I will sometimes add sample sentences I will write*)

*Note: The lecture slides indicated you should also include a summary. This is **not** necessary.*

### Note on annotations

**Paraphrase what you read.** This helps us learn! If you draw specific quotations from the text, this **must** be explicit, using quotation marks. Copy-pasting from the abstract, using direct excerpts without explicitly quoting, etc. all fall into the realm of plagairism, and then it's sad times for everyone.

- **Bad way to paraphrase:** Copy a sentence/paragraph and then "re-phrase" it. This can easily end up back in plagiarism territory.
- **Good way to parapharse:** Read something that you think is worth noting. Turn to a separate window so you cannot see the text (no peeking!) Write down what that thing is as you would describe it to a group mate. Then, revise *that* sentence into something useful for your bibliography, paper, etc.

See the "Craft of Paraphrasing" handout for more detail. 

### Acceptable economics journals

**At least two articles** must come from an economics journal in the **top 200** from the [RePeC list](https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.journals.simple.html).

### Tips

- Check out the [library resources](library_database.html) page for all sorts of help navigating the Howe Library databases! 

- When determining if an article might be useful, start by focusing on the  abstract only. Among those that pass your abstract test, then just read  the introduction to see if they are still going to help.

- When you’ve found an article or two that are useful, you can search forward and backward to find more!

  - Check the references section to find articles that were cited in your paper
  - Use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) to find articles that cite your paper

  ![works cited](https://ec200s22.netlify.app/assignment/materials/scholar_cited.png)

- Note that working paper series are *not* peer-reviewed journal articles. [NBER Working Papers](https://www.nber.org/papers?page=1&perPage=50&sortBy=public_date), for example, are an excellent resoucre but not peer-reviewed. Most reports from large organizations are not peer reviewed.

## Detailed methodology outline 

*I highly recommend at least starting the annotated bibliography before completing this section*

Our *next* major assignment will be to prepare a research protocol. This will include all sorts of items like a data collection template; the actual lists of universities, specific selection criteria for job postings, etc.; templates. The aim of *this* portion is to get as close to that protocol as possible. 

Please create one sub-head per topic, and include your methodology as clearly as possible. Paragraphs or bullet points are fine, so long as all the information is there. Italics indicate items that are completely optional (ie ungraded), but that you might want to include if you get there. **Briefly justify your decisions.** If there are areas where you are not certain, make that clear and explain why you are uncertain or undecided between two choices. See [grading rubric](#Grading) below.

### Key Topics 

#### 1. Sample selection criteria

- [ ] How will you select subjects? Are there inclusion or exclusion criteria, and what are they?
- [ ] How many letters/resumes/profiles will you submit? How many employers/officials/etc. will you target? Is it 2 per employer, 1 per official, something else? 

#### 2. Randomization

- [ ] What are the exact characteristics that you are randomizing? 
- [ ] If working with names/photos, how will you generate them?

*Optional: What do the templates look like, what do the names/photos you will use look like?*

#### 3. Outcome variables 

- [ ] What are the outcome variables you will measure? How will you measure them ? 
- [ ] What other data will you collect? (Characteristics of employer, region, industry, gender, age, etc.)
- [ ] What groups will you compare? 

*Optional: Will you use an Excel/Sheets template, something else, to record responses? How will you do so? You could even prepare a skeleton template*

#### 4. Research ethics 

- [ ] How much time will human subjects (employers, officials, potential dating matches) spend interacting with fake submissions? 
- [ ] How will you protect their identities and avoid negative repercussions? 
- [ ] How will you respond to queries/interest?
- [ ] How will you ensure your data is secure? (we will discuss potential options) 

#### 5. Approximate timeline 

A table will probably be easiest, or you can use a GANTT chart (templates are available for [Excel](https://templates.office.com/en-us/Simple-Gantt-Chart-TM16400962) and [Google Sheets](https://www.smartsheet.com/google-sheets-gantt-chart-templates-complete-collection)) Review assignment deadlines and coordinate as a team. 

Include key activities, milestones, submission deadlines. 

Indicate estimates of the amount of time each activity will take

#### 6. Power calculations 

The [power calculation page](powercalc.html) has lots of resources, explanations, and links.

The idea here is that there is a tension between a small sample size (easy to implement) and a large sample size (greater statistical power), and we want to make an informed decision about the necessary sample size. 

Afer you work through calculating power with the tool of your choice, you'll end up writing something roughly like this: 

> With a sample size of X, evenly divided between White and Hispanic applicants, we calculation that we can detect a difference of Y percentage points if the call back rate for White applicants is Z percent, using a two-sided test, 5% significance level, and 80% power. This rate is comparable to what Houghton and Millicent (1998),who find that the difference in callback rates between White and Hispanic ice-cream customer service providers was A%, and it is slightly less than Barbary (2005), who found a gap of B%. 

Or 

> Following Bansky (2007), we assume a 17% callback rate for Filipino applicants. With a significance level of 5%, a one-sided test, and 80% power, a sample size of 1000 yields a minimum detectable effect size of 11 percentage points, or 65%, which is close to the estimated 60% effect detected by Yemeni and Ralphson (2019).

#### 7. Team captaincies 

*There are many ways to approach group work!* However, because there are multiple elements here, I recommend designating "captains" for specific areas. The idea is that the captain doesn't have to actually do everything (though they may), but the captain has to make sure it does get done. Here are potential captaincies, which you can use, adapt, etc. You may also want to align the specific areas with the tasks in your timeline.

- Preparing templates and randomized elements (ie name, photos, etc) (this could be two pieces)
- Randomization
- Creating actual resumes/letters (with randomized elements included)
- Submitting resumes/letters/etc
- Recording outcomes 
- Conducting data analysis (cleaning, conducting hypothesis tests, presenting results)
- Respective paper elements: Introduction, literature review, empirical methods, results, discussion, conclusion
- Overseeing presentation

There may also be general captaincies that span the entire project duration 

- Editing/proofreading 
- Submitting assignments (to BB)
- Organizing meetings
- Overseeing [data security](data-security)

**Outline who is captain of what, or whatever other approach you prefer to take to assigning tasks.** A table here would be clearest. 

## Refined research question 

This section will build off of your submitted idea proposal for the idea you selected. It will be 1–2 paragraphs that include the following elements. 

1. Key research question(s): Make sure each question is answerable with your methodology
2. How you will answer this/these questions.
3. Why this question is important (for the world)
4. Why this question contributes to our understanding of discrimination in economics

Use in-text citations to support #3 and #4

You will likely iterate it based on the results of your annotated bibliography and experince writing the research methodology, so I would recommend doing this *last*.

## Grading

**The annotated bibliography portion is worth 20 points.**

- Each source is worth 5 points (10 per person), with one point per element listed above.
- The final 10 points are for meeting the source selection critera (N peer-reviewed, 2 top 200 economics journals)

**The research methodology is worth 21 points**

Each section (sample selection criteria, randomization, etc.) is worth 3 points each. For each section, grading is done the following way

- **Three points**: Each required element included and thoughtfully addressed. Decisions are justified, and areas of uncertainty are highlighted rather than left vague
- **Two points:** All or all but one required element is included, but not all are thoughtfully addressed. Some decisions seem arbitrary or are unclear
- **One point:** An attempt at the required elements, but more than 2 are omitted, and the level of detail is insufficient to move toward implementation.

**The research idea is worth 9 points**

Each of the elements listed is worth 2 points. To get full credit for #3 and #4, you should use in-text citations to support your arguments (worth the final point)
