# Data Security 

*[Back to index](index.html)*

When we think about data security, we are concerned about **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**



## What is PII? 

PII is anything you could use to directly or indirectly identify someone. 

> Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any data point or combination of data points that allows someone to identify an individual or household with a reasonable degree of certainty. Examples of individual data points of PII include, but are not limited to, name, GPS coordinates, or address. Examples of  combinations of data points that would qualify as data points would be:  for the US – **zip code, birth date, and gender**. Depending on the context, certain combinations of demographic data points qualify as PII so long  as they can identify an individual or household with a degree of certainty. **For example, the combination of the village name, birth date, gender, and occupation might be identifiable in cases of small  communities*.*** Essentially, it is the link that allows an outside reader to connect survey  responses to a particular person or household. Regulations around PII  apply equally to PII that consists of singular data points and those  that consist of combinations of data points.

## Why do I care about PII? 

All human subjects research must adhere to three key principles: (1) respect for persons; (2) beneficence; and (3) justice, as outlined in the Belmont Report. Respecting participant privacy is a key way to demonstrate respect and also reduce potential harm to participants if the information was inadvertently shared.

There are strict regulations around the protection of PII for studies that are considered human subjects research, according to federal regulations. 

Our project [is not considered human subjects research](https://www.uvm.edu/rpo/irb-policies-and-procedures#student_II) because it is a class project, and not intended for public dissemination.  However, we will still take these considerations very seriously! 



### What should I do ? 

Your team has a few options: 

1. **Never record any PII**. This means your data is "de-identified" as there is no way that *anyone* can ever connect your data to the participants, including you! 
   - In survey work, this would mean completing the survey but never asking the participant's name, phone number, or address, for example. 
   - In a correspondence study, this may or may not be possible. You may *have* to collect PII in order to link employer submissions to callbacks, for example, and to make sure you don't accidentally apply to the same job posting two times. 
2. **Record PII** and store it security (via encryption) 
   - Your data collection spreadsheet/templates will have things like participant or employer names 
   - Store those templates in an encrypted manner. 
   - :rotating_light:**Do not e-mail them. A shared google sheet is not encrypted. A password-protected sheet is not encrypted.** :rotating_light:

​	Best practice is that, once your data collection is complete, you encode the data (Walmart of Williston = 001-VT, Skinny Pancake = 002-VT, Walmart of Albany = 001–NY, etc), and analyze your data using only the codes (drop the names). You can save the "key" in an encrypted file and be more relaxed with the coded data (okay to use a shared doc, for example). Then, delete the key at the end of the project. 



### How do I encrypt data? 

**:star:Recommended :star::** **FREE** version of [Boxcryptor](https://www.boxcryptor.com/en/pricing/) (**do not pay you do not need it**) . Pick one cloud provider (Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc), and make a shared folder. Encrypt the data subfolder and provide access to all team members. I find this easy to use, compatible with the cloud, and it has been approved for use multiple IRB boards. 



Most other options dont' work well for this purpose - at least not those that I know of.  If you find something you think might work, please let me know.
