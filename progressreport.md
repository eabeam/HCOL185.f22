# Progress Reports 



## Objectives 



There are **three** progress reports due during the implementation of your study. The aim of each one is to take stock of what you've accomplished, plan out what's ahead, make adjustments as needed, and get feedback and suggestions on any challenges you're encountering. 

| Deadlines                |                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| November 4 (F) @ 1:10pm  | Progress Report 1 |
| November 11 (F) @ 1:10pm | Progress Report 2 |
| November 18 (F) @ 1:10pm | Progress Report 3 |

## Structure 

Prepare and submit one report as a group, which contains the following elements. This will be 1â€“2 pages and include **five elements.**



1. Team Accomplishments: What did your team complete over the past week? 

2. Tracking: This is just quantitative part. A table is fine. Here's an example that you can use as is or modify to your context. Add other details as you see fit.

   |                    | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Total |
   | ------------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |
   | Target submissions | 300    | 300    | 300    | 900   |
   | Actual submissions | 305    | 297    |        | 512   |
   | # Responses        | 20     | 70     |        | 90    |

3. Findings: This is broad. Potential categories: 

   - Data-related findings: Our response rate so far is X%, Tuesday submissions are not receiving any responses, etc.) 
   - Process-related findings: It's much more efficient to submit things in X way rather than Y; ReBox.com has a great tool for Z 
   - Qualitative findings: Most employers respond kindly, but there were two weird responses...

4. Challenges you encountered, and how you resolved them (or didn't)

5. Plans and goals for the next week

   





## Grading 

Each progress reports are worth 10 points, with 2 points per element. A thoughtful and complete response to each item will earn 2 points, and a partial response will earn 1 point.
