# Independent Research Assignment 

[TOC]

## Assignment overview

The purpose of this assignment is use correspondence study data in order to answer a research question that you develop. You'll use Philippine data from [Beam et al. (2020)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14R9qXCckYSzQPhNg1H2MEppl3faxNDRc/view?usp=sharing) in order to conduct the analysis portion and shape your research question.

Your research paper will follow the general guidance for the group research paper, although the emphasis per section (and grading rubric) will be different.



## Learning objectives 

Through this assignment, you'll achieve the following learning objectives!

- Identify and define a research question and contextualize it in the relevant economics literature 
- Use existing data from a correspondence study  in order to answer the research questions
- Design and conduct an empirical analysis using t-tests and interpret results
- Present research results orally and through a written research paper 



## Deliverables and Deadlines

There are 5 key deliverables, aligned with the group assignment deadlines. 

1. Idea proposal: November 11  *(coincides with group progress report #2)*
2. Progress report: November 18 *(coincides with group progress report #3)*
3. Draft for peer review: December 2 @ 1:10pm
4. Final presentation: Week of December 5
5. Final paper: December 11 @ 11:59pm

Grading weights mirror the group assignment, with full credit assigned for group progress report #1



## Item details 

### Idea Proposal  (Due November 11 @ 1:10pm)

==*Please submit in the Progress Report #2 submission on BB*==

The aim of this assignment is to build a research question and workable analysis plan for your final paper. Use the [Beam et al. (2020)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14R9qXCckYSzQPhNg1H2MEppl3faxNDRc/view?usp=sharing) paper and separate data file in order to build your idea. 

#### Key elements

There are **five** elements in your idea proposal. Note that **#2 is new** and was not part of the earlier assignment!

1. A clearly defined research question. 
   - *When possible, avoid writing a research question where the answer is "yes" or "no." That is, "how much does X affect Y?" rather than "does X affect Y?"*

2. 1–2 sentences about why the answer to this question matters or how it links to what we know from existing literature.

3. A brief description of how you will answer this question.

   - The idea here is to make specific what you're thinking about, so you can determine if it's doable or not, and whether it answers your research question or not. 

   - But don't be afraid of being creative! It would be completely okay (and encouraged!) to say: "We will do X ... {description of X}. Alternatively, we could instead do Y ... {description of long-shot Y}, but there may be challenges if ... {descriptions of why this might be tricky}"
   - For this project, it may involve comparing two groups, comparing multiple groups. It may involve hypothesis testing, creating descriptive graphs, etc. 

4. A statement of your hypothesis - with justification (a good time to reference past readings)

5. Clear statement of your your outcome variable/variables and how the results will answer your research question



#### Grading 

You will be graded with the following rubric, for a total of 10 possible points.

|                                                              | **Does not meet** | **Partially meets** | **Fully meets** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 1. Research  question is clearly stated, specific, and answerable **using provided data** | 0                 | 1                   | 2               |
| 2. Link to literature/motivate importance                    | 0                 | 1                   | 2               |

| 4. Methodology  explained in detail                          | 0                 | 1                   | 2               |
| 5. Outcome variable stated and linked to question            | 0                 | 1                   | 2               |

### Progress Report (Due November 18 @ 1:10pm)

Prepare a 1–2 page write-up (bullet points or paragraphs are fine) that include the following **four** items. 

1. Accomplishments: What did you accomplish over the past week? 
2. Findings: This is a brief summary of what you've done. It *could* include the following (but should include at least some of the following!)
   1. Summary statistics or data visualizations 
   2. Partial or full write up of paper sections
   3. Paper outline
   4. Summary of literature reviewed/annotated. 

3. Challenges you encountered, and how you resolved them (or didn't)
4. Plans and goals for the next week

#### Grading

This progress report is worth 10 points, with 2.5 points per element. A thoughtful and complete response to each item will earn 2.5 points, and a partial response will earn 1.25 point. 

### Draft for peer review (Due December 02, 1:10)



### Final presentation (December 5, 7, or 9)

This assignment will mirror the presentation guidelines for the group project, with any variations noted in the assignment descriptions.



### Final Paper  (December 11, 11:59pm)

**Your final paper will be 2500–3500 words if single-authored or 3500–4500 words if joint-authored** (excluding abstract  and references). 

==Use the [final paper template](research-paper-template.docx) for the group project, noting the following **three ** deviations:==

1. Word count: 2500–3500 single-authored, 3500–4500 if joint authored
2. Study design should reflect description below rather than template (otherwise won't make sense)
   - You don't need a randomization table or timeline
3. You should have at least **two tables and/or figures** if single-authored or **three tables and/or figures** if double-authored. At least one figure should be a bar graph with confidence intervals or a slope graph



It should have the following sections: 

1. **Title and Abstract**

   - Descriptive title

   - Abstract that summarizes the paper and findings in **150–250 words**

2. **Introduction: **This will be an economics-style introduction, following [the introduction formula](https://blogs.ubc.ca/khead/research/research-advice/formula). *Roughly 2–3 pages double spaced*
   1. Note minimum number of references required, noted in [final paper template](research-paper-template.docx)

3. **Literature review** and background. *Roughly 2–4 pages double spaced*. 
   1. Note minimum number of references required, noted in [final paper template](research-paper-template.docx)

4. **Study design:** This will include two components: (a) how data was collection and (b) how you implemented your part of the study. Part (a) will be very brief and summarize whatever points are relevant to your study from Beam et al. (2020). Part (b) will describe any sample restrictions, the empirical strategies you're using to look at your data. *Roughly 2–3 pages*

5. **Results:** Present and discuss results, contextualize. This will need to include the results of at least one hypothesis test. *This will likely be the longest section, roughly 4–6 pages, double spaced*

6. **Conclusion:** This will be an economics-style conclusion. Now, we have a [conclusion formula](http://marcfbellemare.com/wordpress/12060)! *Roughly 1 page, double spaced*

7. **References**

You should have at least **two tables and/or figures** if single-authored or **three tables and/or figures** if double-authored. You can put them in the end or embed in text. **At least one figure should be a bar graph with confidence intervals or a slope graph**

I'll also ask you to attach separately any programs and/or Excel files in which you conduct your analysis.

## Notes regarding extending an existing paper

Because you're extending an existing paper, a lot of key content will be available in [Beam et al. (2020)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14R9qXCckYSzQPhNg1H2MEppl3faxNDRc/view?usp=sharing) - discussions of the experimental design, etc. A few guidelines: 

- Avoid plagiarism by using in-text citations when you are pulling ideas from the source paper (and of course, elsewhere too). Key rule is whether it's clear where you are getting your ideas from: 
  - Okay (I can follow the link across sentences): The experiment was conducted by Beam et al. (2020). They submitted 7,576 resumes to 4000 positions over 12 weeks. They found that goldfish were especially responsive. 
  - Not okay (Who did this?!): For this study, 7,756 resumes were submitted to 4000 over 12 weeks, and goldfish were especially responsive. 
- In economics, we usually avoid direct quotations (nature of the type of papers). If you do use them, you *must* put them in quotation marks.
